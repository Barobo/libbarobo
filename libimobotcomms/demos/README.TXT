All programs in this folder are decribed in the Mobot User's Guide.
To run these programs, you need to add bluetooth addresses of
your robots to a configuration file through the RobotController. If the robot
is currently connected to the RobotController, disconnect from the robot first
before executing any demo programs.

Additional sample prorams are available in the folder samples/
Each program in this folder is accompanied with a picture,
