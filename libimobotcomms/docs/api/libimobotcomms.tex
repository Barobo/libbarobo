\noindent
The header file {\bf mobot.h} defines all the data types, macros 
and function prototypes for the robot API library. The header file
declares a class called \texttt{CMobot} which contains member functions which
may be used to control the robot.

%\begin{tabular}{ll}
\hline
Function & Description \\
\hline
%\texttt{pose()} \dotfill & Pose multiple joints of the robot. \\
\texttt{CMobot()} & The CMobot constructor function. This function
is called automatically and should not be called explicitly. \\
\texttt{\textasciitilde CMobot()} & The CMobot destructor function. This function
is called automatically and should not be called explicitly. \\
& \\
\texttt{connect()} & Connect to a remote robot module. This function 
connects to the first robot listed in the Barobo configuration file. To
edit the configuration file, use the robot control graphical user interface,
and select the menu item ``Robot $\rightarrow$ Configure Robot Bluetooth''. \\
\texttt{connectWithAddress()} & Connect to a robot module by specifying its Bluetooth address. \\
\texttt{disconnect()} & Disconnect from a robot module. \\
\texttt{getJointAngle()} & Gets a joint's angle. \\
%\texttt{getJointDirection()} & Gets a motor's currently assigned direction. \\
\texttt{getJointMaxSpeed()} & Gets a joint's maximum speed in radians per second. \\
\texttt{getJointSpeed()} & Get a motor's current speed setting in radians per second. \\
\texttt{getJointSpeeds()} & Get all motor's current speed settings in radians per second. \\
\texttt{getJointSpeedRatio()} & Get a motor's speed as a ratio of the motor's maximum speed. \\
\texttt{getJointSpeedRatios()} & Get all motor speeds as ratios of the motor's maximum speed. \\
\texttt{getJointState()} & Get a motor's current status. \\
\texttt{isConnected()} & This function is used to check the connection to a robot. \\
\texttt{isMoving()} & This function is used to check if any joints are currently in motion. \\
\texttt{move()} & Move all four joints of the robot by specified angles. \\
\texttt{moveNB()} & Identical to \texttt{move()} but non-blocking. \\
