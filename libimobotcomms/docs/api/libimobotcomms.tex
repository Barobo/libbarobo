\noindent
The header file {\bf mobot.h} defines all the data types, macros 
and function prototypes for the MoBot API library. The header file
declares a class called \texttt{CMobot} which contains member functions which
may be used to control the robot.

%\begin{tabular}{ll}
\hline
Function & Description \\
\hline
%\texttt{pose()} \dotfill & Pose multiple joints of the MoBot. \\
\texttt{CMobot()} & The CMobot constructor function. This function
is called automatically and should not be called explicitly. This constructor will 
automatically try to connect with a paired MoBot using the \texttt{connect()} member
function. To specify an address to connect to, please use the
\texttt{CMobot(const char address[], int channel);} constructor.\\
\texttt{CMobot(const char address[], int channel);} & 
An alternate constructor which may be used to explicitly specify the address of a MoBot 
to connect to. \\
\texttt{\textasciitilde CMobot()} & The CMobot destructor function. This function
is called automatically and should not be called explicitly. \\
& \\
\texttt{connect()} & Connect to a remote MoBot module. This function connects to an already-paired MoBot module in Microsoft Windows. This function does not currently work for non-Windows operating systems, such as Mac or Linux. For those operating systems, please use the \texttt{connectWithAddress()} function instead. \\
\texttt{connectWithAddress()} & Connect to a MoBot module by specifying its Bluetooth address. \\
\texttt{disconnect()} & Disconnect from a MoBot module. \\
\texttt{getJointAngle()} & Gets a joint's angle. \\
%\texttt{getJointDirection()} & Gets a motor's currently assigned direction. \\
\texttt{getJointSpeed()} & Gets a motor's speed. \\
\texttt{getJointState()} & Gets a motor's current status. \\
\texttt{isConnected()} & This function is used to check the connection to a MoBot. \\
\texttt{move()} & Move all four joints of the MoBot by specified angles. \\
\texttt{moveNB()} & Identical to \texttt{move()} but non-blocking. \\

Function & Description \\
\hline
\texttt{moveContinuousNB()} & Move joints continuously. Joints will move untill stopped.\\
\texttt{moveContinuousTime()} & Move joints continuously for a certain amount of time.\\
\texttt{moveTo()} & Move all four joints of the MoBot to specified absolute angles. \\
\texttt{moveToNB()} & Identical to \texttt{moveTo()} but non-blocking. \\
\texttt{moveJointTo()} & Set the desired motor position. \\
\texttt{moveJointToNB()} & Identical to \texttt{moveJointTo()} but non-blocking. \\
\texttt{moveJointWait()} & Wait until the specified motor has stopped moving. \\
\texttt{moveWait()} & Wait until all motors have stopped moving. \\
\texttt{moveToZero()} & Instructs all motors to go to their zero positions. \\
\texttt{moveToZeroNB()} & Identical to \texttt{moveToZero()} but non-blocking. \\
%\texttt{setJointDirection()} & Set the motor direction of a motor. Set
to "0" for automatic direction, "1" for forward, and "2" for reverse. \\
\texttt{setJointSpeed()} & Sets a motor's speed. \\
\texttt{stop()} & Stop all currently executing motions of the MoBot. \\

\texttt{motionInchwormLeft()} \dotfill & Inchworm gait towards the left. \\
\texttt{motionInchwormLeftNB()} \dotfill & Identical to \texttt{motionInchwormLeft} but non-blocking. \\
\texttt{motionInchwormRight()} \dotfill & Inchworm gait towards the right. \\
\texttt{motionInchwormRightNB()} \dotfill & Identical to \texttt{motionInchwormRight} but non-blocking. \\
