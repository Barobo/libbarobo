\vspace{-0.1in}
\begin{description}
\item               
\begin{tabular}{p{15 mm}p{145 mm}}
\texttt{time} & A pointer to an array which will store time values for each of the distance readings. \\
\texttt{distance1} & A pointer to an array which will store the distance values for each time. \\
\texttt{distance2} & ... \\
\texttt{distance3} & ... \\
\texttt{distance4} & ... \\
\texttt{radius} & The radius of the wheels on the mobot. \\
\texttt{seconds} & The number of seconds between distance readings. The minimum value allowed for
this variable is 0.05. \\
\texttt{threshold} & (optional) This argument indicates whether or not to align the first
detected motion to the y-axis. 
\end{tabular}
\end{description}

\noindent
{\bf Description}\\
This function is used in conjunction with the \texttt{recordDistancesEnd()}
function to accurately record the motion of a Mobot joint at a relatively fast
rate. 

The function will allocate memory and fill the \texttt{time} and \texttt{distance} arrays with data
at the rate specified by \texttt{seconds}. The \texttt{time} and \texttt{distance} arrays should
be freed by the user to prevent memory leaks.

If the communication speed cannot maintain 
the requested rate, (if \texttt{seconds} is too low, in other words), the function will
collect data as fast as possible. The minimum value for \texttt{seconds} is 0.05, but
the actual minimum time will depend on other factors, such as communication noise and
distance to the mobot.

When the \texttt{recordDistancesBegin()} function is called, the Mobot library will 
immediately begin recording distance data. The \texttt{recordAngleEnd()} function
must be called to halt the recording process.
