\section{The \texttt{imobotcomms} iMobot Remote Control Library}
The \texttt{imobotcomms} library is a collection of functions geared towards
controlling the motors and reading sensor values of an iMobot module via the
Bluetooth wireless protocol. The functions are designed to be intuitive
and easy to use. Various functions are provided to control or obtain the speed,
direction, and position of the motors. The API includes C-style functions as well
as a C++ class called \texttt{CiMobotComms} to facilitate C++ style api function
calls. 

This documentation introduces the basic computer setup required for controlling 
the iMobot, as well as several demo programs and a complete reference for all
API function provided with the \texttt{imobotcomms} library.

\section{Bluetooth Pairing with the iMobot}
To control the iMobot with the Bluetooth wireless protocol, the controlling 
computer must be equipped with Bluetooth. If the computer does not have
Bluetooth built-in, an external USB Bluetooth dongle may be used. The following
instructions are for a Windows 7 computer with built-in Bluetooth. The basic
process is the same for Windows XP and Vista, although the screenshots may
appear different. 

The first step is to open the Bluetooth applet by double-clicking the Bluetooth
icon in the applet tray normally found at the bottom right of the screen, as
shown highlighted in red in the following figure.

\end{center}

After double-clicking the icon, a new window will appear similar to the following.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=5in]{images/imobot_connect_1a.png}
\end{center}

Next, click on the
button labeled "Add Wireless Device" towards the top of the window. This 
will bring up the following dialog.

\begin{center}

\end{center}

This dialog shows a list of all Bluetooth wireless devices that are in range.
Among them should be the iMobot you wish to connect to. If the iMobot does not
appear on this list, please ensure that the iMobot is within 10 meters of the
connecting computer and that the iMobot is powered on. Double click on the icon
representing the iMobot to proceed. Once you have double-clicked the icon, the
following dialog box should appear.

\begin{center}

\end{center}

Select the second option, labeled ``Enter the device's pairing code''. iMobot
modules come hard-coded with a default pairing code. When prompted for the
pairing code, enter ``1234''. Once the computer is paired with the iMobot,
the following dialog box may pop up asking to install drivers.

\begin{center}

\end{center}

If the previously illustrated dialog box appears, just click the ``cancel''
button at the bottom right. No extra drivers are necessary for controlling the
iMobot module.

At this point, the following dialog should be shown.

\begin{center}

\end{center}

The next step is to enable the iMobot control service. 
Double-click on the icon denoting the
iMobot module to bring up the following dialog:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=5in]{images/imobot_connect_7.png}
\end{center}

Click on the tab labeled ``Services''

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=5in]{images/imobot_connect_8.png}
\end{center}

Ensure that the service titled ``iMobot Control'' is enabled. If it is not
enabled, click on the check-box to enable it. Click on the ``Ok'' button to
accept the changes and close the dialogs. The iMobot is now ready to be
controlled with the iMobotComms library.

\section{Basics of a Ch iMobot Program}
To help the user become acquainted with the iMobot control programs, one sample
program will be presented to illustrate the basics and minimum requirements of
an iMobot control program. 

The beginning of every iMobot control program will include header files. Each
header file imports functions used for a number of tasks, such as printing
data onto the screen or controlling the iMobot. 

\begin{verbatim}
#include <stdio.h>       // Required for printf()
#include <imobotcomms.h> // Required for iMobot control functions
\end{verbatim}

Next, we must initialize the C++ class used to control the iMobot. This line
initializes a new variable named \texttt{robot} which represents the remote
iMobot module which we wish to control. This special variable is actually an
instance of the \texttt{CiMobotComms} class, which contains its own set of
functions called ``methods'' or ``member functions''.
\begin{verbatim}
CiMobotComms robot;
\end{verbatim}

The next line will use the \texttt{poseZero} member function. The
\texttt{poseZero} function causes the iMobot to move all of its motors to the
zero position.
\begin{verbatim}
robot.poseZero();
\end{verbatim}

The majority of iMobot control functions do not wait for the robotic motions to
complete before continuing. As such, if we want to wait for the robot to fully
complete the requested motion before continuing with the rest of the program,
we must use the \texttt{moveWait} function, as such.
\begin{verbatim}
robot.moveWait();
\end{verbatim}

The next four lines of code command motors 3 and 4 to rotate 90 degrees, and
then waits for the motors to stop moving.
\begin{verbatim}
robot.setMotorPosition(IMOBOT_MOTOR3, 90);
robot.setMotorPosition(IMOBOT_MOTOR4, 90);
robot.waitMotor(IMOBOT_MOTOR3);
robot.waitMotor(IMOBOT_MOTOR4);
\end{verbatim}
