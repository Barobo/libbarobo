The \texttt{CMobotGroup} class is used to control multiple modules simultaneously. The
member functions of the \texttt{CMobotGroup} class closely mimic those of the \texttt{CMobot}
group. The main difference is that the member functions of the \texttt{CMobot} class
affect a single robot, whereas the member functions of the \texttt{CMobotGroup} class
move and affect a group of many robots.

\hline
Function & Description \\
\hline
%\texttt{pose()} \dotfill & Pose multiple joints of the robot. \\
\texttt{CMobotGroup()} & The CMobotGroup constructor function. This function
is called automatically and should not be called explicitly. \\
\texttt{\textasciitilde CMobotGroup()} & The CMobotGroup destructor function. This function
is called automatically and should not be called explicitly. \\
& \\
\texttt{addRobot()} & Add a robot to be a member of the robot group. \\
\texttt{move()} & Move all four joints of the robots by specified angles. \\
\texttt{moveNB()} & Identical to \texttt{move()} but non-blocking. \\
\texttt{moveContinuousNB()} & Move joints continuously. Joints will move untill stopped.\\
\texttt{moveContinuousTime()} & Move joints continuously for a certain amount of time.\\
\texttt{moveJointContinuousNB()} & Move a single joint on all robots continuously. \\
\texttt{moveJointContinuousTime()} & Move a single joint on all robots continuously for a specific amount of time. \\
\texttt{moveTo()} & Move all four joints of the robots to specified absolute angles. \\
\texttt{moveToNB()} & Identical to \texttt{moveTo()} but non-blocking. \\
\texttt{moveJoint()} & Move a motor from its current position by an angle. \\
\texttt{moveJointNB()} & Identical to \texttt{moveJoint()} but non-blocking. \\
\texttt{moveJointTo()} & Set the desired motor position for a joint. \\
\texttt{moveJointToNB()} & Identical to \texttt{moveJointTo()} but non-blocking. \\
\texttt{moveJointWait()} & Wait until the specified motor has stopped moving. \\
\texttt{moveWait()} & Wait until all motors have stopped moving. \\
\texttt{moveToZero()} & Instructs all motors to go to their zero positions. \\
\texttt{moveToZeroNB()} & Identical to \texttt{moveToZero()} but non-blocking. \\
%\texttt{setJointDirection()} & Set the motor direction of a motor. Set
%to "0" for automatic direction, "1" for forward, and "2" for reverse. \\
\texttt{setJointSpeed()} & Set a motor's speed setting in radians per second. \\
\texttt{setJointSpeeds()} & Set all motor speeds in radians per second. \\
\texttt{setJointSpeedRatio()} & Set a joints speed setting to a fraction of its maximum speed, a value between 0 and 1. \\
\texttt{setJointSpeedRatios()} & Set all joint speed settings to a fraction of its
maximum speed, expressed as a value from 0 to 1. \\
\texttt{setTwoWheelRobotSpeed()} & Move the robot at a constant forward velocity. \\
\texttt{stop()} & Stop all currently executing motions of the robot. \\
