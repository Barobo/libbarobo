\chapter{Getting Started}
This short guide will enable you to run the provided demo program,
``simple.cpp'', on the iMobot.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Download and install a VNC client
  \begin{itemize}
  \item For Windows, you may download and install TightVNC from \texttt{http://www.tightvnc.com}.
  \item For Mac OS X, you may download and install Chicken of the VNC from\\
  \texttt{http://sourceforge.net/projects/cotvnc/}
  \end{itemize}
\item Log in to the imobot with a VNC client. 
\item Connect to the iMobot with your VNC client. The default address of the iMobot is \texttt{192.168.0.123}.
\item Open and execute the demo program.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Copy the demo program to your home directory with the command\\
  \texttt{cp /usr/local/ch/package/chimobot/demos/simple.cpp \textasciitilde/}
  \item Open the demo program with ChIDE. You may left click on the desktop to open the menu, and select \texttt{Applications -> Accessories -> ChIDE}.
  \item Click on \texttt{File -> Open} within ChIDE and open the program, \texttt{simple.cpp}. 
  \item Click on the ``Run'' button, located near the top right of the ChIDE Window. The robot should now run the program.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Graphical Control Interface}
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4in]{gui_screenshot.png}
\caption{\label{fig:gui}The iMobot Graphical Control Interface.}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
The iMobot comes with a graphical control interface for controlling the iMobot.
The control interface is able to perform simple locomotion tasks, and can be
used to determine the joint angles of the iMobot. A screenshot of the interface
is shown in Figure \ref{fig:gui}.

The graphical interface can be found in the application menu of the iMobot. Once
a VNC connection to the iMobot has been established, simply left click on the
desktop to bring up the menu, and select the item \texttt{Applications ->
Accessories -> iMobot Controller}. Once the controller starts, it needs to be
initialized in order to establish communication with the motor controllers.
This is done by clicking on \texttt{File -> Init Local I2C Bus}. Ensure that 
the application is connected by ensuring that the status bar at the bottom of the
application displays ``Connected''. 

The graphical interface is composed of six basic components, as shown in
Figure \ref{fig:gui}. There are three components on the top half of the
interface, and three on the bottom half. Each component is discussed in
detail in the following subsections.

\subsection{The iMobot Diagram and ``Move To Zero'' Button}
The first section of the GUI located on the top left of the interface
displays a schematic diagram of the iMobot, displaying motor positions.
Underneath the diagram, there is a large button with the text 
``Move To Zero''. When clicked, this button will command the connected
iMobot to rotate all of its joints to a flat ``Zero'' position.

\subsection{Individual Joint Control}
The second section, located at the top-middle section of the interface,
is the ``Individual Joint Control'' section. These buttons command the
iMobot to move individual joints. When the up or down arrows are clicked,
the iMobot begins to move the corresponding joint in either the positive,
or negative direction. The joint will continue to move until the stop 
button, located between the up and down arrows, is clicked. 

\subsection{Rolling Control}
This section contains buttons for controlling the iMobot as a 
two wheeled mobile robot. The up and down buttons cause the iMobot to
roll forward or backward. The left and right buttons cause the iMobot 
to rotate towards the left, or towards the right. The stop button in the
middle causes the iMobot to stop where it is.

\subsection{Joint Speeds}
The ``Joint Speeds'' section, located at the bottom left of the interface,
displays and controls the current joint speeds of the iMobot. Joint speeds
are a value between 0 and 1, with 1 meaning maximum joint power, and 0
meaning zero joint power. The speed may be set by sliding the vertical 
sliders to the desired positions. 

\subsection{Joint Positions}
This section, located in the bottom-middle of the interface, is used to display
and control the positions of each of the four
joints of a iMobot. The joint positions are displayed in the numerical
text located above each vertical slider. The displayed joint positions are in
units of degrees.  There are two methods to control
the joints using this interface.

The first method of controlling the joints is by using the vertical sliders.
Each vertical slider's position represents a joint's angle. The sliders for the
two end joints vary from -180 degrees to 180 degrees, representing one complete
rotation. The angles for the two body joints vary from -90 to 90 degrees. When
the position of the slider is moved, the iMobot will move its joints to match the 
sliders. 

The second method for moving the joints is by entering the exact angles for the
joints. Below each of the four sliders lies a text entry box. Values in degrees
may be typed into each of the four entry boxes. When the button on the lower
right of the section labeled ``Move'' is clicked, the iMobot will move its joints
to match the values typed into the boxes. If no value is typed into a box, that 
joint will not move.

\subsection{Motions}
This section, located on the bottom right of the interface, contains a set of
preprogrammed motions for the iMobot. To execute a preprogrammed motion, simply
click on the name of the motion you wish to execute, and then click the button
labeled ``Play''.

% SUB: Overview of Sample Application Programs {{{
\chapter{Overview of Sample Application Programs}
\subsection{\texttt{simple.cpp} : A Simple Bare-Bones Demo}
The following program is a simple program which moves some joints on the iMobot
before initializing the robot to listen for incoming Bluetooth commands.
\subsubsection{simple.cpp \label{subsec:simple.cpp}}
\listinginput{1}{../demos/simple_cpp/simple.cpp}
\subsubsection{Explanation of simple.cpp}
\begin{itemize}
\item 
\begin{verbatim}
  CiMobot robot;
\end{verbatim}
This line declares the \texttt{robot} object, which represents the
capabilities of the iMobot module. iMobot modules are represented by
the \texttt{CiMobot} type. This object contains various member
functions which may be executed by the user.
\item 
\begin{verbatim}
  robot.moveToZero();
\end{verbatim}
These commands command the iMobot to move all motors to their zero positions
and wait until the motion is finished.
\item 
\begin{verbatim}
  robot.moveTo(90, 0, 0, 90);
\end{verbatim}
These lines instruct the robot to rotate the faceplates, which are the first
and fourth joints, by 90 degrees. 
\item 
\begin{verbatim}
  robot.moveTo(0, 0, 0, 0);
\end{verbatim}
The previous line causes the iMobot to move the first and fourth joints back to
their original position.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\texttt{bluetoothListener.cpp} : A Demo That Receives and Executes
Bluetooth Commands}
The following program is a bare-bones demo program which initializes the iMobot's
Bluetooth listening capabilities. The program sets up the iMobot so that Bluetooth
enabled devices can connect to and control the iMobot remotely. 
\subsubsection{bluetoothListener.cpp}
\listinginput{1}{../demos/bluetoothListener/bluetoothListener.cpp}
\subsubsection{Explanation of \texttt{bluetoothListener.cpp}}
\begin{itemize}
\item 
\begin{verbatim}
  CiMobot robot;
  int i;
\end{verbatim}
Similar to the previous demo, the first line declares a \texttt{CiMobot} object
called \texttt{robot}. The second line declares an integer variables called 
\texttt{i}.
\item
\begin{verbatim}
  for(i = 1; i <= 4; i++) {
    robot.setJointSpeed((iMobotJointId_t)i, 50);
  }
\end{verbatim}
The next lines execute a \texttt{for} loop which cycles through each of the four
iMobot joints and sets their speeds to \texttt{0.50}, or 50\% speed.
\item
\begin{verbatim}
  robot.initListenerBluetooth(20);
\end{verbatim}
This line initializes the iMobot's Bluetooth listening service. The function argument
is the Bluetooth channel to listen on. In this line of code, channel 20 is chosen
as the iMobot's listening bluetooth channel. 
\item
\begin{verbatim}
  robot.listenerMainLoop();
\end{verbatim}
This function blocks indefinitely, allowing the iMobot to handle any number of Bluetooth
commands from the remote device. The \texttt{listenerMainLoop()} will return if the
``Quit'' command is sent to the iMobot from the remote device.
\end{itemize}
