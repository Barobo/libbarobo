\chapter{Quickstart Guide}
This quickstart guide will enable you to run the provided demo program,
``simple.cpp'', on the iMobot.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Log in to the imobot. In order to do this, you will need a VNC client. 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item For Windows, you may download and install TightVNC from \texttt{http://www.tightvnc.com}.
  \item For Mac OS X, you may download and install Chicken of the VNC from \texttt{http://sourceforge.net/projects/cotvnc/}.
  \end{itemize}
\item Connect to the iMobot with your VNC client. The default address of the iMobot is \texttt{192.168.0.123}.
\item Copy the demo program to your home directory with the command ``\texttt{cp /usr/local/ch/package/chimobot/demos/simple.cpp ~/}''.
\item Open the demo program with ChIDE. You may left click on the desktop to open the menu, and select \texttt{Applications -> Accessories -> ChIDE}.
\item Click on \texttt{File -> Open} within ChIDE and open the program, \texttt{simple.cpp}. 
\item Click on the ``Run'' button, located near the top right of the ChIDE Window. The robot should now run the program.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Overview of Sample Application Programs}
The following program is a simple program which moves some joints on the iMobot
before initializing the robot to listen for incoming Bluetooth commands.
\subsection{simple.cpp \label{subsec:simple.cpp}}
\listinginput{1}{../Demos/simple_cpp/simple.cpp}
\subsection{Explanation of simple.cpp}
\begin{itemize}
\item Lines 8-10 declare some local variables that are used throughout the program.
\item Line 10 declares the \texttt{robot} object, which represents the
capabilities of the iMobot module. This object contains various member
functions which may be executed by the user.
\item Lines 13-16 send commands to the iMobot to move all the joints to their
zero position.
\item Line 17 causes the program to wait until all the joints have stopped moving. 
\item Lines 20 and 21 instruct the robot to rotate joints 2 and 3 to rotate 90
degrees. Note that the joint numbers start at 0, so joints 2 and 3 are the
third and fourth joints, respectively. 
\item Lines 23 and 24 cause the program to wait until the third and fourth
joints have stopped moving.
\item Lines 26 and 27 instruct the robot to turn the third and fourth joints
back to their original zero position.
\item Lines 28 and 29 cause the program to wait until the third and fourth
joints have stopped moving.
\item Lines 33 and 34 start the Bluetooth listening service on channel 20,
which listens for Bluetooth remote commands and controls the robot accordingly. 
\item Line 37 terminates the robot control.
