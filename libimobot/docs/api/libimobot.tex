\noindent
The header file {\bf libimobot.h} defines all the data types, macros 
and function prototypes for the iMobot API library. The header file
declares a class called \texttt{CiMobot} which contains member functions which
may be used to control the robot.

\hline
Function & Description \\
\hline
\texttt{CiMobot()} & The \texttt{CiMobot} constructor function. This function
is called automatically and should not be called explicitly. This constructor will 
set up initial internal parameters for the iMobot. \\
\texttt{\textasciitilde CiMobot()} & The \texttt{CiMobot} destructor function. This function
is called automatically and should not be called explicitly. \\
& \\
\texttt{getJointAngle()} & Gets a joint's angle. \\
\texttt{getJointSpeed()} & Gets a motor's speed. \\
\texttt{getJointState()} & Gets a motor's current status. \\
\texttt{initListenerBluetooth()} & Initializes an iMobot to start listening on
a Bluetooth channel for incoming Bluetooth connections. \\
\texttt{isConnected()} & This function is used to check the connection to an iMobot. \\
\texttt{move()} & Move all four joints of the iMobot by specified angles. \\
\texttt{moveNB()} & Identical to \texttt{move()} but non-blocking. \\
\texttt{moveContinuousNB()} & Move joints continuously. Joints will move untill stopped.\\
\texttt{moveContinuousTime()} & Move joints continuously for a certain amount of time.\\
\texttt{moveTo()} & Move all four joints of the iMobot to specified absolute angles. \\
\texttt{moveToNB()} & Identical to \texttt{moveTo()} but non-blocking. \\
\texttt{moveJointTo()} & Set the desired motor position. \\
\texttt{moveJointToNB()} & Identical to \texttt{moveJointTo()} but non-blocking. \\
\texttt{moveJointWait()} & Wait until the specified motor has stopped moving. \\
\texttt{moveWait()} & Wait until all motors have stopped moving. \\
\texttt{moveToZero()} & Instructs all motors to go to their zero positions. \\
\texttt{moveToZeroNB()} & Identical to \texttt{moveToZero()} but non-blocking. \\
%\texttt{setJointDirection()} & Set the motor direction of a motor. Set
%to "0" for automatic direction, "1" for forward, and "2" for reverse. \\
\texttt{setJointSpeed()} & Sets a motor's speed. \\
\texttt{stop()} & Stop all currently executing motions of the iMobot. \\
